Title: Smart QR + Geofenced Attendance Management System

Description:
Build a web + mobile-friendly prototype for a QR-based attendance system with geofencing and analytics. The app must support faculty and students with different interfaces, integrate with Firebase (Firestore + Authentication), and enforce security through dynamic token-based QR codes.

üéØ Core Requirements
1. Frontend

Technology: React (JavaScript) + TailwindCSS.

Two Interfaces:

Faculty Web Interface:

Faculty can log in securely.

Faculty can create a new session by selecting:

Semester (1‚Äì8)

Branch (3 options predefined)

Subject (6 subjects per semester)

On session start, the system generates a QR code that refreshes every 2 seconds (token-based).

Faculty dashboard should display:

Current active session with QR code (auto-refresh)

Session analytics (number of scans, attendance %).

Ability to manually mark attendance for a student.

Student Mobile-Friendly Interface:

Students log in via OTP (Firebase Auth, phone number OTP).

Home screen has a ‚ÄúScan QR‚Äù button.

On scanning a QR code, attendance is marked in Firestore.

Student dashboard shows:

Attendance % per subject

Overall attendance trend (charts)

2. Backend & Database

Backend: Firebase as Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS).

Database: Firestore.

QR Token System:

Every 2 seconds, a new tokenized QR code is generated.

All generated tokens map to the same session ID.

On scan, attendance is logged with fields:

student_id

session_id

timestamp

geofencing_status (inside/outside campus).

Faculty Overrides: Faculty can mark attendance manually from their dashboard.

3. Geofencing Feature

Geofencing is an optional security layer.

Uses device GPS to check if the student is inside campus boundaries.

Behavior:

If inside campus ‚Üí attendance = valid.

If outside campus ‚Üí attendance still recorded, but field geofencing = "outside".

If GPS/location fails ‚Üí system still records attendance, without blocking.

Admin/Faculty should have a toggle to enable/disable geofencing.

4. Dashboards & Analytics

Faculty Dashboard:

Real-time attendance count.

Session summary (present vs absent).

Analytics per subject (attendance trends, student %).

Student Dashboard:

Attendance % by subject.

Trend line of attendance.

Warnings for low attendance subjects.

üõ† Technical Requirements

Frontend: React + TailwindCSS.

Mobile Support: Student UI should be mobile-responsive and look like a simple Android app.

Backend/Database: Firebase Firestore + Firebase Authentication.

Authentication:

Faculty ‚Üí Email/Password login.

Students ‚Üí OTP-based login (Firebase phone auth).

QR Generation: Token-based, auto-refresh every 2 seconds.

Geofencing: Optional toggle, remark-based attendance if outside campus.

üé® Prototype Expectations

Show faculty view (session creation, QR generator, analytics).

Show student view (OTP login, scan QR, attendance tracking).

Show QR auto-refresh flow.

Show geofencing toggle effect (inside/outside campus record).

Use charts for analytics (pie chart for present/absent, line chart for trends).
